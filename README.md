## What is needed
+ Build Backend

+ ReactJs for frontend
+ Nodejs and expressjs for backend
+ Sessions and cookies auth to track user activities
+ MongoDb and mongoose for database management
+ software for handling pictures or videos**
+ Tailwind Css and radixui for styling
+ Host server on render/railway/ 
+ Host frontend on vercel or netlify


## Todo list for the backend 

+ initiate the server
+ connect the database
